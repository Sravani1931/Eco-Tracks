A full-stack web application that helps users track and calculate their daily carbon footprint based on activities like transportation, diet, and energy usage. Users can log entries, view personalized reports with interactive visualizations (e.g., charts showing emissions over time), and receive eco-friendly tips to reduce their impact. Built with a focus on sustainability and user-friendly design.

This project demonstrates end-to-end development skills, including frontend interactivity, backend API handling, database integration, authentication, and deployment. It's deployed live and ready for use!

## ‚ú® Features
- **User  Authentication**: Secure signup/login with JWT and password hashing (bcrypt).
- **Activity Logging**: Forms to input daily activities (e.g., miles driven, meals eaten, energy usage) with real-time CO2 calculations using standard formulas (e.g., 0.4 kg CO2 per mile for cars).
- **Personalized Reports**: Dashboard with visualizations using Chart.js (line/bar charts for emissions trends over time).
- **Eco Tips**: Personalized suggestions based on high-emission activities (e.g., "Switch to public transit to save 20% CO2").
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly UI with Tailwind CSS.
- **Bonus Integration**: Weather-based tips via OpenWeather API (e.g., "Bundle up‚Äîreduce heating use today").

Quantified Impact: Handles data for 100+ simulated users, providing interactive dashboards to visualize and reduce carbon footprints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Chart.js (for charts), Axios (for API calls), Tailwind CSS (styling).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (API server), Mongoose (ORM).
- **Database**: MongoDB (cloud-hosted on Atlas).
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, bcrypt for passwords.
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend), MongoDB Atlas (DB).
- **Other Tools**: Git/GitHub for version control, CORS for frontend-backend communication.
